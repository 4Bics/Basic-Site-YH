A number of studies demonstrate high interpersonal variability in Postprandial Glycemic Responses (PPGRs) to the same food. Which dispels the generalisation that all foods have equal health benefits. YOOR Diet provides curated lists of beneficial foods and stay away foods based on CGM data set results.</Tab.Pane> },

Seeing low metabolic health scores drives behaviour. Providing instantly accessible metabolic data makes you more conscious and thoughtful of what types of food you consume, having actionable data - guides behaviour and drives results.</Tab.Pane> },
