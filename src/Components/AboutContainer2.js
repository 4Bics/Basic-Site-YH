              The perception of a standard Healthy Diet is becoming more challenged based on growing evidence of variable impacts to individual metabolic responses. A number of studies demonstrate high interpersonal variability in Postprandial Glycemic Responses (PPGRs) to the same food. Which dispels the generalisation that all foods have equal health benefits. YOOR Diet provides curated lists of beneficial foods and stay away foods based on CGM data set results.
